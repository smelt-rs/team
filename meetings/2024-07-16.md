# Argon

Dead space between enthusiast (Cargo) and Google (Bazel)
- Some open source projects are growing into the middle space (tokio, gix)

## Amazon

Internal build systems
- Adapters, e.g. cargo hitting a proxy
- Default build logic
  - Started as Bash script, grown to Rust program
  - Keeps growing
  - Reinventing Cargo, wanting to avoid
  - Requires tweaking, which is its own skill set
  - Further away from idiomatic Rust


Wants to upstream, benefit all

- PGO
- dependency fetch separate from ...
- nightly features
    - Hacks for administering it out


"There is no 'not doing the work', so let's do it open source"


List
- polyglot
  - Obsolete `build.rs`
  - Speak to other systems or provide a module
- Docker-like layer caching
  - Per-user caching?
  - Really, about finding another path to get built version of a package

Name: `alloy`: combine Rust with other things

Background: improving app development

Goal:
- avoid post-build.rs which people look to to solve a lot of these problems
- and avoid one-off cargo subcommands that reinvent these needs

Quake
- Declarative targets / deps like
- Commands using https://www.nushell.sh/
  - Data-oriented
  - Cross-platform, building on uutils for strong

## Meetings

Once a month

## Owner

True polyglot need to be bigger than just Rust
- Too ambituous to be purely polyglot?
- Focus on expertise and MVP

## Staffing

Amazon
- Overall goal for Weihang and Jacob
- Bernardo will be involved but busy

Futurewei
- Caussandra
- Ed: at least involved

Robius
- Jonathan: at least involved

## Current efforts

Caussaundra
- quake

Weihang
- build.rs

Ed
- caching

Jacob
- pubgrub

## Next Steps

- epage: create org
- epage: create team repo
- epage: start conversation
- weihang: talk to Arlo
- bernardo: can we get him to research?
- caussandra
  - leptos
  - dioxus
